creating repositories in nexus

how to upload to nexus

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Added the below entry to pom.xml of the maven project


 <distributionManagement>
   <snapshotRepository>
      <id>prod</id>
      <url>http://localhost:8081/repository/production/</url>
   </snapshotRepository>
</distributionManagement>

Here we are asking maven to upload all artifacts to the url mentioned in the <url> section 
Note: please change the url according to your setup


***************please make a note of <id>prod</id> 

in settings.xml under M2_HOME directory we should have the below entry

(you can Copy paste the below line to settings.xml )
<server>
      <id>prod</id>
      <username>admin</username>
      <password>admin123</password>
    </server>


    during mvn deploy phase

    maven will  parse POM file and find out that it has to deploy the artifacts to a repository with id prod and the credentials to connect to the repository is retrieved from

    settings.xml <server></server> tab, here it is admin and admin123
